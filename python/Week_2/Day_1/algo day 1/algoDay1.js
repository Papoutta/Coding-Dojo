// the client will give us a data that is odd and non empty.
// the goal is to return the only element that has no matching pair.
// we are going to loop through the data from the start to the end with the index i(position of looping inside the data)
// we define a var counter that is initialised to 1 
// inside the loop we are going to loop again with the index j (position of looping inside the data not the same as i)
// if  the the num of the index i is equal to the num of index j we give to the count+1
// if count is positive the reslt will be num[i]
